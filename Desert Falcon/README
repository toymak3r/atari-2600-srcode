MAC and ALN *love* to eat memory.  You may have to remove or
shrink massive ramdisks and desk accessories.

The example programs were assembled with the following assembler
command lines:

	mac -p example				==> example.prg
	mac -p example1				==> example1.prg
	mac -p example2				==> example2.prg
	mac -p bugs shift images		==> bugs.prg
	mac -p instmac				==> instmac.prg
	mac code				==> code.o
	mac code65				==> code65.o
