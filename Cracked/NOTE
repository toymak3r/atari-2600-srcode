
Dear Julie

	This version is the "RANCH Screen Milestone". The changes made
in addition to the ranch screen stuff are:

	1	 The 3 levels of dificulty are implemented
	2	 The "demo" mode plays the game better.
	3 	 The  animations move more smoothly
	4	 The walking character on the subway screen 
		 is entirely new.
	5	 The rooster character on the ranch screen
		 is new.

 The addition of the two player mode is started. I am trying to
 find room for:

	1	Two player select logic
	2	Two player graphics on all intro and game over
		screens
	3	Egg indicator on ranch screen.

  Please call me after you have a chance to look at the cart.


					Thanks,

					 Bruce Williams
